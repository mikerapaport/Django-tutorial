This is a workspace I'm using to follow the Django introductory tutorial found here:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/

3 steps to change a model:
1. Change model in models.py
2. run ```python manage.py makemigrations``` to create migrations for those changes
3. Run ```python manage.py migrate``` to apply those changes to the db
